# Telos Antelope <> EVM Token Bridge

This repository contains the smart contracts of our Telos Token Bridge divided in two parts: EVM & Antelope.

_To create a bridgeable erc20 token that you can register on the bridge, paired with an Antelope eosio.token token, refer to our [ERC20Bridgeable](https://github.com/telosnetwork/erc20-bridgeable) repository._

Refer to each folder for specific documentation on deploying each side of your own token bridge.
